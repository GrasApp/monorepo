before sharing a project with devs,

provide a concise readme describing the project structure,
common commands, most important packages, and dependency heirarchy

clone the project into a new dir,
run all the processes needed to build and start the project
make sure no necessary files are missing
make sure functionality is working

ask:
How can I simplify the setup process for devs?
How can I use the conventional project commands more intuitively?
How can I automate the most?
