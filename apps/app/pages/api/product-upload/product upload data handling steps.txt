product upload data handling steps:

// PREVIOUS DATA FLOW
// data comes from request body
// get product from db
// get images from product
// push new uploaded images to images
// delete images from product
// delete files from image bucket
// filter out deletedImages
// create new productData, use uploaded data, or use product data
// update db table

// currently does this way, for less networking requests, possibly need to use the older way for scalability and prevent using mutated data 
// CURRENT DATA FLOW
// data comes from request body
// get images from request
// delete images from product
// delete files from image bucket
// filter out deletedImages
// create new productData, use uploaded data
// update db table
